So powerful that it will cleanly cut through any material known to men and is likely to fatally strike and behead most any foe.
#
witchinggadgets_research_name.WALLMIRROR=Mirror on the Wall
witchinggadgets_research_text.WALLMIRROR=[WG] The most magical of all!
witchinggadgets_research_page.WALLMIRROR.1=Further delving into the magic of the mirrors has lead you to the discovery of a safe haven within the void between worlds.<BR>While this location is brimming with magic, otherwise it appears to be void of anything. It has no visible layer of flooring, yet somehow you can stand there.<BR>This space seems to be an excellent way of traveling. Since it is vast and empty as well, it should be easy to store any of your belongings in this void-between-worlds
witchinggadgets_research_page.WALLMIRROR.2=Â§lAccess:Â§r<BR>Place the mirror wherever you like. When you'd like to open the portal, simply right-click it. The dimension accessed through it is the same from any mirror, but portals out of it are only created where it is entered. This means that you can only leave where another Mirror has been placed in the Overworld.<BR><BR>Â§lNavigation:Â§r<BR>An invisible floor will spawn in a 5x5 below you wherever you walk. These blocks can be replaced with normal blocks by right-clicking them, allowing you to build there. Jump to ascend, the floor will follow you. Holding the sneak key will make you descend.
#
witchinggadgets_research_name.ETHEREALWALL=Ethereal Wall
witchinggadgets_research_text.ETHEREALWALL=[WG] Hidden in plain sight
witchinggadgets_research_page.ETHEREALWALL.1=Refining the enchantments on arcane stone just a bit more has led to an interesting discovery. Simply applying a redstone signal to this new type of stone will make it Â§onon-corporealÂ§r, allowing you to pass through it.<BR>This also affects any other Etheral Wall connected to the powered block.<BR>Furthermore, you can disguise this stone to the appearance of most common blocks. Simply click it with a block in hand it and this one will take its texture. Sneak and click it with an empty hand to remove the disguise.
witchinggadgets_research_page.ETHEREALWALL.2=Furthermore, you can disguise this stone to the appearance of most common blocks. Simply click it with a block in hand it and this one will take its texture. Sneak and click it with an empty hand to remove the disguise. (It will only accept the texture of normally rendered blocks. Vanilla transparency works, Thaumcraft's Amber doesn't because it's coloured transparency, directional textures like wooden logs and quartz pillars are not fully supported)
#
witchinggadgets_research_name.STONEEXTRUDER=Thaumic Stone Extruder
witchinggadgets_research_text.STONEEXTRUDER=[WG] One can never have enough stone
witchinggadgets_research_page.STONEEXTRUDER.1=Even those that are not skilled in the arts of Thaumaturgy are aware of how flowing lava will solidify into cobblestone when cooled by water. Those skilled in the magical arts don't want to waste their time on the tedious digging of these stones and have therefore created an automated way.<BR>This machine will create cobblestone, break it and place it either on the ground or into a connected inventory. Work will be halted if the inventory is full or a redstone signal is applied. You can use a wand to rotate it.
#
witchinggadgets_research_name.AGEINGSTONE=Ageing Stone
witchinggadgets_research_text.AGEINGSTONE=[WG] Time flies when you're having fun!
witchinggadgets_research_page.AGEINGSTONE.1=Every young Thaumaturge can't wait to grow up! But that would rob you of too many wonderful experiences. So instead you have decided to channel your knowledge of such time dilating arts into another form of Arcane Stone.<BR>The Ageing Stone will accelerate the ageing of most common creatures, making lambs, calves and piglets grow up much faster when exposed to it's magical energies.<BR>The Ageing Stone will apply this effect to all creatures in a 7x7x5 area centered around itself, with more blocks increasing the effect.

witchinggadgets_research_name.SPINNINGWHEEL=Spinning
witchinggadgets_research_text.SPINNINGWHEEL=[WG] Don't prick yourself
witchinggadgets_research_page.SPINNINGWHEEL.1=While many great Wizards neglect the practice of spinning and weaving, many of them do that by underestimating its true power. A number of magical artifacts are the product of clothwork, including every thaumaturge's robes. Some witches will testify that spellcrafting in itself even has a lot in common with weaving, requiring careful handling of the respective components; be it raw magic in its aspects or thread.
witchinggadgets_research_page.SPINNINGWHEEL.2=             Â§lCraftingÂ§r<LINE>Every practitioners start into the field should be made by creating their very own Â§lSpinning WheelÂ§r. It will be used if in aquiring yarn, be it mundane, of exquisite material or some enhanced with magic. This yarn will then later be used to weave the fabric from which to craft various garments or magic artifacts. See the Â§lLoomÂ§r for further details.

#
witchinggadgets_research_name.LOOM=Loom
witchinggadgets_research_text.LOOM=[WG] Weavin' Magic
witchinggadgets_research_page.LOOM.1=To process further the process the yarn and thread gained by spinning, the wizard will have to craft himself a magic loom on which to weave his magic fabric. This  construct will not only interweave the threads, it will also infuse them with various Â§lAspectsÂ§r, granting them magical properties. To infuse the fabric with aspects, simply make sure a Â§lWarded JarÂ§r containing some is in the vicinity<BR>To start the weaving after setting the recipe, simply tap the loom with your wand.
#
witchinggadgets_research_name.ARCANEAUTOCRAFTER=Arcane Crafter
witchinggadgets_research_text.ARCANEAUTOCRAFTER=[WG] Au-Thaum-nomous Crafting!
witchinggadgets_research_page.ARCANEAUTOCRAFTER.1=Those mages who discovered the secrets of immortality (you recognize them by the long, white beard) have all the time in the world. But what about your average thaumaturge? In order to save yourself some time, why not let someone else do the tedious and repetitive crafting operations? Of course, no one would entrust a golem with something as powerful as a wand, but this semi-sentient wooden table will do nicely.
witchinggadgets_research_page.ARCANEAUTOCRAFTER.2=Simply set your preferred recipe (normal recipe or arcane crafting), provide it with the materials and, if needed, a charged wand, and wait for it to do your bidding. Note however, that the knowledge of crafting is limited to that of the player who put down the block.
#
witchinggadgets_research_name.CALCULATOR=Arcane Abacus
witchinggadgets_research_text.CALCULATOR=[WG] 3-4 = Warp?
witchinggadgets_research_page.CALCULATOR.1=As a skilled thaumaturge, close to achieving eldritch knowledge, you are an expert on chaos. ...It might also stem from your lack of mathematical knowledge. But who would bother themselves with sciences of the common man when there are enchantments that do it for you?<BR>The Arcane Abacus will take some of the mundane mathematics off your hands. Use it on a Node that contains compound aspects and it will calculate it to primal values. Use it on an Infusion Matrix to check the stability value and point out misplaced stabilizers.
witchinggadgets_research_page.CALCULATOR.2=Â§oThe highest infusion instability known to man *cough*Thaumic Tinkerer*cough* is 15. Stabilizing your altar beyond that is pointless.

#
witchinggadgets_research_name.BAGOFTRICKS=Bag of Tricks
witchinggadgets_research_text.BAGOFTRICKS=[WG] Did I hear an echo in there?
witchinggadgets_research_page.BAGOFTRICKS.1=Further advancements in magical weaving have led you to the discovery of the Â§lCloth of Spacious FoldsÂ§r. A most interesting weave, which seems to contain more room in its folds than visible from the outside. Crafting a bag from this provides you with space for storage to easily carry on your person.<BR>The fabric also turns out to be very protective of its contents, and it will harm any but the owner, should they try to access the bag. Â§oThis behaviour can be toggled by the owner by sneak+rightlick.Â§r
witchinggadgets_research_page.BAGOFTRICKS.r1=<IMG>witchinggadgets:textures/gui/research/weavingRecipes1.png:0:0:255:255:0.5</IMG>Â§lCloth of Spacious FoldsÂ§r
witchinggadgets_research_page.BAGOFTRICKS.2=Any of the bags created from the cloth are dyeable, craft them without any dye to return them to their default colour.
#
witchinggadgets_research_name.ADVANCEDROBES=Bewitched Fleece
witchinggadgets_research_text.ADVANCEDROBES=[WG] Sizzling with Magic
witchinggadgets_research_page.ADVANCEDROBES.1=The dark side of Â§mthe forceÂ§r Thaumaturgy holds a lot of power. By slightly tapping into that power, you can weave a fabric much more rich of magic. With that, you can now make yourself better garments strengthened in their magic potential.
witchinggadgets_research_page.ADVANCEDROBES.r1=<IMG>witchinggadgets:textures/gui/research/weavingRecipes4.png:0:0:255:255:0.5</IMG>Â§lBewitched FleeceÂ§r
#
witchinggadgets_research_name.CLOAK=Cloak
witchinggadgets_research_text.CLOAK=[WG] Swish!
witchinggadgets_research_page.CLOAK.1=After noticing the excellent "swishing"-properties of Enchanted Fabric, you have quickly drawn out some schematics to create a cloak from it. While this standard cloak lacks any special abilities, its magical fabric should provide an excellent base for more advanced spellwoven mantles.<BR>Â§oTo be equipped in the Traveller's Gear inventory, the default keybinding is 'Numpad 7'. Certain abilities of the advanced cloaks can be activated. This is done via the 'Active Abilities'-menu of Traveller's Gear. The default keybinding is 'R'.Â§r
#
witchinggadgets_research_name.CLOAK_STORAGE=Cloak of Voluminous Pockets
witchinggadgets_research_text.CLOAK_STORAGE=[WG] I lost my keys in here...
witchinggadgets_research_page.CLOAK_STORAGE.1=Combining the concept of your Bag of Tricks with that of the fashionable cloak, you now have more storage capabilities right on your body! The cloak also has 50% more capacity.
#
witchinggadgets_research_name.CLOAK_RAVEN=Mantle of the Raven
witchinggadgets_research_text.CLOAK_RAVEN=[WG] CA-CAW!
witchinggadgets_research_page.CLOAK_RAVEN.1=On your travels throughout the Twilight Forest, you have come across the most fascinating Forest Raven. This remarkable bird displays high agility and maneuverability in the air, a feat to be envious of.<BR>Instead of being envious you could also just adorne your cloak with their feathers and imbue it with magical power...<BR>While wearing this cloak, your speed while flying increases noticeably. And should you not be flying, the cloak will allow you to glide instead. Gliding can be disabled in the ActiveAbility menu.
# OLD witchinggadgets_research_page.CLOAK_RAVEN.1=On your travels throughout the Twilight Forest, you have come across the most fascinating Forest Raven. This remarkable bird appears to always find back to his nesting place, even within the dense and dark forest it calls home.<BR>Plucking a feather from it, you have discovered that it, albeit in small scale, inherits this ability. Now you just have to amplify this ability with your thaumic capabilities and infuse your garment with it. The result is the Â§lMantle of the RavenÂ§r which allows you to set and return to your nesting place at the cost of a raven's feather. You may substitute three chicken feathers.
#
witchinggadgets_research_name.CLOAK_SPECTRAL=Spectral Mantle
witchinggadgets_research_text.CLOAK_SPECTRAL=[WG] Now you see me...
witchinggadgets_research_page.CLOAK_SPECTRAL.1=The plane of the spectral beings is a mystery to most common men. Fortunately, you are not most men. After infusing a cloak with eldritch and spectral energies it will grant you the ability to 'shift' yourself to that plane. While walking among it, you are invisble to those that walk along the normal plane. Enemies will not see or target you unless they are creatures of eldritch, posses exemptual powers or are wearing Goggles of Revealing.<BR>This ability comes at the cost of being unable to interact with the physical world. You cannot attack, use items, break or activate blocks. Furthermore it will drain 1 aer vis from you inventory every 5 seconds.
witchinggadgets_research_page.CLOAK_SPECTRAL.2=Â§oDisclaimer: Creatures that can still see you include: Eldritch Guardians, Eldritch Wardens, Eldritch Golems, Cultist Praetors, as well as boss mobs like the Wither or the Enderdragon. Any other user of this cloak will also be able to see you.Â§r
#Creating a cloak that is invisible is an easy task for a thaumaturge, but applying the effect to it's wearer was the hard task. After tedious research however, you have created the Â§lCloak of InvisibilityÂ§r, a garment that renders you invisible to the naked eye. The cloak itself lost a bit of his magic in the process, now only turning mostly transparent, leaving a slight shimmer. Other armor pieces or items that you are holding in your hand are not affected.
#
witchinggadgets_research_name.CLOAK_WOLF=Cloak of the Wolf
witchinggadgets_research_text.CLOAK_WOLF=[WG] What a big mouth you have!
witchinggadgets_research_page.CLOAK_WOLF.1=The old tales tell of the beserkers, unrelenting warriors, imbued by ancient magic and wrapped in the fur of a wolf.<BR>Your studies have revealed magical procedures like these and for reasons of style and nostalgia you decided they were best integrated into a cloak of wolf fur. Should you sustain damage while wearing it, you gain additional attack damage and speed, akin to the fearless warriors of old.
#
witchinggadgets_research_name.ENDERBAG=Enderlinked Bag
witchinggadgets_research_text.ENDERBAG=[WG] Everywhere and nowhere at once!
witchinggadgets_research_page.ENDERBAG.1=By attuning your Bag of Tricks to the enderic frequencies of your personal Ender Chest, you now have access to its contents from anywhere in the world.<BR>Don't try to turn it inside out.
#
witchinggadgets_research_name.WGBAUBLES=Witching Wearables
witchinggadgets_research_text.WGBAUBLES=[WG] It's like a magic boutique
witchinggadgets_research_page.WGBAUBLES.1=What looks like catalogue pages from a wizarding equipment store actually proved to be arcane shematics for magical garments! Â§oAll of these are to be equipped in Baubles or Traveller's Gear slots. The default keybinding for the TG inventory is 'Numpad 7'.Â§r<BR>Â§lSteadfast Spaulders:Â§r<BR>These shoulderpads are not designed to be very fashionable, and their protection value is negligable. However, the magic infused into them is able to root you to the floor, so that you shall not waver when stuck by enemy attacks. Â§oGrants you 60% knockback resistance.Â§r
witchinggadgets_research_page.WGBAUBLES.2=Â§lBeserkers Bracers:Â§r<BR>Covered in wolven fur, these vambraces wont hold off blades. But by the magic infused into them, they grant the user the ferociousness of a wolf. Also, they are incredibly fluffy. Â§oIncreases your attack damage by 2 points.Â§r
witchinggadgets_research_page.WGBAUBLES.3=Â§lVambraces of Steady Progression:Â§r<BR>These vambraces, designed by dwarven thaumaturgists, are designed to grant you the ability of digging a hole at a steady pace without interruption. To achieve that, they react dynamically to the working conditions, increasing the user's dig speed while sumberged in water, flying in the air, or when confronted with highly resilient materials.<BR>They also increase the speed at which you climb ladders, for when you eventually need to outrun the thing you woke in the dark below.
witchinggadgets_research_page.WGBAUBLES.4=Â§lSeraph's Shoulders:Â§r<BR>Flying is an ability many wish for. It is quite an advanced form of magic that allows users to fly, but a small jump in the air is within your possibilities.<BR>These shoulders spawn some powerful magical wings, which allow you to perform a second jump in midair.
#
witchinggadgets_research_name.CLOAKKAMA=Kama
witchinggadgets_research_text.CLOAKKAMA=[WG] It's not a kilt!
witchinggadgets_research_page.CLOAKKAMA.1=Cloaks and their advanced deriatives have proven to be both fashionable and useful, but also quite big and unwieldly. Shortening them and attaching them to a belt transforms them into a Kama, a sort of half-skirt covering the back of the legs. They still perform the same tasks, they are just located at a different part of your body now.<BR>Â§lÂ§4WARNING: Due to an unknown error, shift clicking the result out of the crafting table will result in a loss of NBT-data. In order to preserve enchantments on the cloak, its colouration and items stored inside it, make sure to take the Kama out of the slot with a normal click.
#

witchinggadgets_research_text.INFERNALBLASTFURNACE=[WG] IT BURNS!...it smelts, actually...
witchinggadgets_research_page.INFERNALBLASTFURNACE.1=Burning with an intensely hot magical flame, this furnace is the Thaumaturge's response to the engineer's tedious steps of cleaning their ores. It will smelt any clusters of metal thrown within it into three ingots, which the occasional nugget added to that.<BR>Furthermore, should you require steel for other operations, the impure flame of this devilish artifact is a surefire way to get it. Simply throw in iron bars or blocks and wait.<BR>The speed of this construct can be increased by the same means as on the Infernal Furnace.
witchinggadgets_research_page.INFERNALBLASTFURNACE.2=For normal smelting purposes however, this flame is far too hot, so don't try throwing chicken into it.<BR>Disclaimer: Though the lava in this furnace has been enhanced by magic, it is still jsut as (if not more) dangerous. Any items not supposed to go into this furnace will be vapourized, as will any Thaumaturge stupid enough to fall into it.
witchinggadgets_research_page.INFERNALBLASTFURNACE.3=Â§oThe Thaumonomicon is a bit unprecise in its depiction of this construct's structure. The stair blocks at the top actually need to face towards the middle block, with the corners fitting in.Â§r

This construct will consume essentia of the respective aspect as well as Â§2TerraÂ§0 vis. Per 4 essentia and 4 vis consumed, it will change the biome of a nearby coordinate within a 16 block radius.
witchinggadgets_research_page.TERRAFORMER.2=The most basic of the Terrestrial Foci represents the Plains biome. For it to work its magic, it will need to be supplied with Â§2HerbaÂ§0 essentia.

witchinggadgets_research_text.TERRAFORMFOCUS_JUNGLE=[WG] Welcome!
witchinggadgets_research_page.TERRAFORMFOCUS_JUNGLE.1=The animal friendly thaumaturge does his best to keep his cats happy.

To go along with it, this Sauna Stove will fill the area around it with a pleasant, cleansing steam.<BR>While subjected to this steam, you are protected from warp effects and you have a small chance of reducing your temporary warp. However, after a sauna visit you will also be left quite hungry!<BR>The Stove needs only water to work, which can be inserted with a fluid container like buckets or pumped in directly. One bucket of water will keep the stove going for 10 minutes!

witchinggadgets_research_page.ENCH_INVISIBLEGEAR.1=Armor is incredibly useful, everyone can agree on that. It will save your life in most fights. But it can also be a hinderance when you are trying to be stealthy.<BR>Say you drink a potion of invisiblity. It works perfectly and makes you nigh untraceable, weren't it for that clunky armor. But the skilled Thaumaturge fixes that easily, infusing his armor with magical enchantments that make it invisible to the common viewer!

With the right glasses, you can see those creeps, and look right back at them!<BR>This enchantment can be applied to the Goggles of Revealing or other headgear of the same function. While wearing the enchanted item, you will be able to see creatures with the invisibility buff. Furthermore, the Translucency enchantment is rendered ineffective when used by others and users of the spectral mantle are shown more clearly.
#
witchinggadgets_research_name.ENCH_STEALTH=Enchantment: Stealth
witchinggadgets_research_text.ENCH_STEALTH=[WG] Sneaky!
witchinggadgets_research_page.ENCH_STEALTH.1=More often than not, sneaking is not an option due to the high senses of the creatures you face. Well now it is! Applying this enchantment to your boots or leggings will give you a chance of staying undetected while you are crouching. The chance rises by 20% with every level, but is diminished by 50% if you are in view of the target in question.<BR>Should you be discovered, all enemies in a 5 block radius will be notified.

#GEMCUTTING
witchinggadgets_research_name.GEMCUTTING=Gem Cutting
witchinggadgets_research_text.GEMCUTTING=[WG] Everything is crystal clear!
witchinggadgets_research_page.GEMCUTTING.1=Gemcutting is one of the oldest yet most refined forms of giving magic a physical form. If a gem is infused with magic, it is no longer dependant on the user. Any mortal can use the power stored inside a cut gem, making this a viable option of giving power to those not skilled in the thaumaturgic arts.<BR>Gems vary in their function based on their cut and the magical essence infused into them.
witchinggadgets_research_page.GEMCUTTING.2=Â§lNatural AffinitiesÂ§r<BR>Some stones have inheirent natural affinities for certain aspects, which applies a natural strengthening to their effect. If the affinity matches the infused aspect, the gem will be enchanted with "Brilliance", the level depending on the amount of essences used in the creation.<BR>Â§lNatural AversionsÂ§r<BR>Similarly, some gems have natural aversions to certain aspect, and infusing them with them will make the resulting gem brittle, weakening it's effect and adding a chance for reuseable gems to break.<BR> Hold shift while looking at a gem to see its affinites and aversions.
# witchinggadgets_research_page.GEMCUTTING.2=<IMG>witchinggadgets:textures/gui/research/gemcuts.png:0:0:80:80:1</IMG>Â§lPoint CutÂ§r<BR>The point cut is the most basic shape to be cut into a gem. It allows the basic storage of aspected vis, but its energy can only be released in by crushing it, leaving Gemstone Dust.
#effects
witchinggadgets_research_page.GEMCUTTING.3=            Â§lPoint CutÂ§r<LINE>The point cut is the most basic form you can give to your infused gem. While it can store thaumic energies, the only way to release this energy is by crushign the gem, leaving behind some gemstone dust. The effects varying by aspect, are as follows:<BR>Â§eÂ§lAer: Â§rÂ§0You aquire a short-term, high powered jumpboost.<BR>Â§2Â§lTerra: Â§rÂ§0Grants you knockback resistance.<BR>Â§cÂ§lIgnis: Â§rÂ§0Iluminates an area around you with temporary glimmers of light.
witchinggadgets_research_page.GEMCUTTING.4=Â§3Â§lAqua: Â§rÂ§0Releases a blast of freezing energy, turning water into ice and solidifying lava around you.<BR>Â§7Â§lOrdo: Â§rÂ§0Restores some of your lifepoints.<BR>Â§8Â§lPerditio: Â§rÂ§0Inflicts some temporary warp upon you.

witchinggadgets_research_page.GEMCUTTING.5=              Â§lOval CutÂ§r<LINE>The oval cut is an advanced form of the infused gems. With the increase in facettes, it can store much more energy and release it in smaller, concentrated bursts. The effects are quite different from those of the point cut gems and these can be recharged with vis of a matching aspect.<BR>Due to its complexety, using a base gem without a natural affinity for the aspect makes the resulting gem very brittle, and in turn, the essentia required to create a brilliant gem has increased.
witchinggadgets_research_page.GEMCUTTING.6=Â§eÂ§lAer: Â§rÂ§0The energies propell you through their air. Consumes 1 charge per use.<BR>Â§2Â§lTerra: Â§rÂ§0Upon using it on a block, it checks connected blocks for ores. Consumes 1 charge per use.<BR>Â§cÂ§lIgnis: Â§rÂ§0Starts a fire at the targeted block. Consumes 1 charge per use.<BR>Â§3Â§lAqua: Â§rÂ§0Creates a block of clean water at the targeted block. Consumes 2 charges per use.<BR>Â§7Â§lOrdo: Â§rÂ§0Guides you to the nearest Node. Consumes 2 charges per use.<BR>Â§8Â§lPerditio: Â§rÂ§0When targeted at a Magical Mirror, it will teleport you to the linked mirror. Consumes 16 charges per use.

witchinggadgets_research_page.PRIMORDIALGLOVE.1=The knowledge of the Primordial Pearl let you decipher some of the eldritch scribbles you dealt with before. They contained plans for an armorset designed to channel the energies of the void through gemstones. Sadly, only sketches of the gauntlet were decipherable.<BR>This gauntlet features an inbuilt Â§5Node TransducerÂ§0, and when its claws close upon a node, it will never let it go again, unless it is replaced by another.<BR>The five sockets on this device will accept infused gems, and their power can be channeled through it, while their recharge speed is based on the aspects of the contained node.
witchinggadgets_research_page.PRIMORDIALGLOVE.2=It should be noted that the sockets will stabilize the gems inside them, so they will never break upon use, but simply recharge.<BR>To select the active gem, the same keybinding as for switching wand foci is used. Sneak while pressign that key to open the inventory in order to add or remove gems.<BR>The pearl is not consumed during the crafting process.

A bag of magical cloth, infused with the energies of the void, which destroys the physical matter of all things inserted into it and sets the magical energies of that item free.<BR>How to work it: Open it up and give it examples of the items you would like to go into it. Then, when that item is picked up (only works on in-world pickups, not on items added to your inventory through other means), they will be destroyed and a random primal aspect contained within them is given to you as vis, charging your wand.

witchinggadgets_research_page.ADVANCEDSCRIBINGTOOLS.1=Every thaumaturge knows the pain of aquiring the ink necessary to further his studies. More often than not, he has to hunt for squids himself! To avoid these troubles in future, you have thought up a much more potent set of scribing tools. They might be expensive in their creation, but their pool of magical ink is ten times the size of normal scribing tools. And to top that, it is not refilled by ink sacks cut out from slimey squids, but from purest light and some small quantities of gold.

witchinggadgets_research_page.ELITERUNICARMOR.1=While runic armor is an excellent form of protection, you have come to realize that you can also apply these runes to actual armor. With that you are not only granted normal armor, the bigger surface also allows more runes, increasing the pool of runes this armor provides. A wise mage would use the newly aquired set of scribing tools, because this procedure drains a hundred units of ink and a standard pen would break from this.

You can create a Â§lIconographic PlateÂ§r of anything you would usually scan at the cost of a Â§lMirrored GlassÂ§r from your inventory. You can take iconographs even of things you have previously scanned, but only the use of a Â§lDeveloped IconographÂ§r grants you the research aspects. And this studying of the picture abides by the same rule as the scan with the Thaumometer. Increase the number of ink and paper in the development recipe to create more than one copy of the picture.
